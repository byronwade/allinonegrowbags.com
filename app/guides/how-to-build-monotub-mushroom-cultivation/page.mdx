    <GuideStep number={1} title="Gathering Materials & Tools">
        ### Essential Items:
        - **64-quart clear plastic bin**  
        - **1-inch & 2-inch hole saw drill bits**  
        - **Self-healing injection port grain bags**  
        - **Sterilized grain spawn** (rye, millet, or wheat berries)  
        - **Bulk substrate** (manure-based or hardwood blend)  
        - **70% isopropyl alcohol**  
        - **Nitrile gloves** and microfiber towels  

        ### Optional Upgrades:
        - Fresh air exchange (FAE) fan  
        - Ultrasonic humidifier with hose  
        - Programmable cycle timer  
    </GuideStep>

    <GuideStep number={2} title="Constructing the Monotub">
        Follow these steps for proper hole placement:

        1. **Mark positions**:  
           - **Lower holes (2-inch)**: 8.5 inches from base (2 per long side, 1 per short side)  
           - **Upper holes (1-inch)**: 4.5 inches from base (3 per long side)  
        2. **Drill holes** in reverse mode to prevent plastic cracking  
        3. **Deburr edges** with a utility knife

    </GuideStep>

    <GuideStep number={3} title="Preparing Grain Spawn">
        ### Inoculation Process:
        1. **Sterilize workspace**: Wipe surfaces with 70% isopropyl alcohol  
        2. **Inject spores**: Use 3-5cc of spore syringe or liquid culture into grain bags  
        3. **Colonize**: Store at 72-75°F for 14-28 days until fully white  

        <Callout type="warning" icon="⚠️">
            Discard bags with green mold, sour smells, or excessive moisture—these indicate contamination.
        </Callout>
    </GuideStep>

    <GuideStep number={4} title="Mixing Spawn & Substrate">
        ### Substrate Recipes:
        - **Manure-based**: 50% pasteurized horse manure, 50% coconut coir  
        - **Hardwood-based**: 80% oak pellets, 20% wheat bran  

        ### Layering Process:
        1. **Sanitize tub**: Wipe with alcohol  
        2. **Add substrate**: Layer 1-inch substrate, grain spawn, and repeat  
        3. **Top layer**: Finish with 1-inch substrate casing  

        <Callout type="tip" icon="💡">
            A proper substrate-to-spawn ratio is crucial for success. Aim for 2:1 or 3:1 substrate to spawn.

    </GuideStep>

    <GuideStep number={5} title="Colonization Phase">
        Monitor these conditions for optimal growth:
        
        - **Temperature**: Keep at 72-75°F  
        - **Humidity**: Maintain 90-95%  
        - **Light**: Provide indirect ambient light (12h/day)  
        - **Timeline**: Allow 2-3 weeks for full colonization

    </GuideStep>

    <GuideStep number={6} title="Fruiting & Harvesting">
        ### Triggering Mushroom Growth:
        1. **Introduce FAE**: Remove micropore tape from lower holes  
        2. **Mist daily**: Maintain 85-90% humidity with distilled water  
        3. **Harvest**:  
           - **Psilocybe**: Before the veil breaks  
           - **Oyster Mushrooms**: When caps flatten  

        <Callout type="tip" icon="💡">
            Harvest mushrooms by gently twisting and pulling from the base. Don't leave stumps that could rot.

    <FAQ items={[
        {
            question: "How long does monotub colonization take?",
            answer: "Most species colonize in 2-3 weeks at 72-75°F (22-24°C). Slower growth may indicate low temperatures or potential contamination. Maintain consistent conditions for optimal results."
        },
        {
            question: "Can I reuse a monotub?",
            answer: "Yes! Clean thoroughly with a 10% bleach solution, replace all filters, and ensure complete disinfection between uses. However, if contamination occurred, it's safer to start with a new tub."
        },
        {
            question: "How many holes should a monotub have?",
            answer: "The optimal setup is six 2-inch holes (8.5 inches from base, 2 per long side, 1 per short side) and three 1-inch holes (4.5 inches from base, per long side) for proper passive FAE."
        },
        {
            question: "What's the best substrate for monotubs?",
            answer: "For most species, use either a manure-based mix (50% pasteurized horse manure, 50% coconut coir) or a hardwood-based mix (80% oak pellets, 20% wheat bran)."
        },
        {
            question: "How do I prevent side pinning?",
            answer: "Use a black plastic liner that sticks to the substrate as it shrinks. This prevents a microclimate from forming between the substrate and tub wall."
        },
        {
            question: "When should I introduce fruiting conditions?",
            answer: "Wait for 100% colonization (substrate fully white), then remove micropore tape from lower holes and begin misting. Rushing this step can lead to contamination."
        },
        {
            question: "What size monotub should I use?",
            answer: "A 64-quart clear plastic bin is ideal for most growers. It provides enough space for good yields while remaining manageable in size."
        },
        {
            question: "Why isn't my monotub pinning?",
            answer: "Common causes include low humidity, insufficient FAE (Fresh Air Exchange), or improper temperature. Ensure humidity is 85-90%, holes are properly placed, and temperature is 65-70°F during fruiting."
