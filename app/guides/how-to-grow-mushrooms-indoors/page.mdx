<GuideStep number={2} title="What You'll Need to Get Started">
    Before you begin, gather these essential supplies:

    - **All-in-one grow bag**: A pre-sterilized bag with substrate and nutrients.
    - **Spore syringe or liquid culture**: High-quality spores for inoculation.
    - **Disposable gloves**: To maintain a sterile environment.
    - **70% isopropyl alcohol**: For sanitizing surfaces and tools.
    - **Spray bottle**: For maintaining humidity during fruiting.
    - **Temperature controller**: To keep conditions ideal (70-75°F or 21-24°C).

</GuideStep>

<GuideStep number={3} title="Setting Up Your Indoor Growing Space">
    Create the perfect environment for your mushrooms:

    - Choose a **small, clean area** like a closet, shelf, or corner of a room.
    - Clean all surfaces with **isopropyl alcohol** to prevent contamination.
    - Set up a **temperature controller** to maintain 70-75°F (21-24°C).
    - Ensure **indirect light** is available—mushrooms don't need direct sunlight.
    - Use a **spray bottle** to maintain humidity levels during fruiting.

    <Callout type="warning" icon="⚠️">
        Avoid areas with drafts or high traffic, as these can introduce contaminants.
    </Callout>
</GuideStep>

<GuideStep number={4} title="Inoculation: Starting Your Mushroom Grow">
    Inoculation is the process of introducing spores into your grow bag:

    - Shake your **spore syringe** well to distribute spores evenly.
    - Clean the needle with alcohol and insert it through the **injection port**.
    - Inject **2-3cc of spore solution** into the grow bag.
    - Seal the injection port to prevent contamination.

</GuideStep>

<GuideStep number={5} title="Colonization: Waiting for Mycelium Growth">
    After inoculation, your mushrooms will begin to colonize the grow bag:

    - Store the grow bag in a **clean, undisturbed area**.
    - Maintain a consistent temperature of **70-75°F (21-24°C)**.
    - Check daily for **white mycelium** spreading through the substrate.
    - Avoid opening the bag during this stage to prevent contamination.

    <Callout type="tip" icon="💡">
        Colonization typically takes 2-3 weeks. Be patient—good things take time!
    </Callout>
</GuideStep>

<GuideStep number={6} title="Fruiting: Growing Your Mushrooms">
    Once colonization is complete, it's time to initiate fruiting:

    - Cut a small slit in the grow bag to allow fresh air exchange.
    - Mist the inside of the bag with a **spray bottle** to maintain humidity.
    - Provide **indirect light** for 12 hours a day.
    - Harvest your mushrooms when the caps fully open but before the veil breaks.
