# Optimal Growing Conditions for Mushrooms

Creating the right environment is crucial for successful mushroom cultivation. This guide covers everything you need to know about maintaining optimal growing conditions.

## Temperature Control

Temperature plays a vital role in mushroom growth:

- **Colonization**: 70-75°F (21-24°C)
- **Fruiting**: 65-70°F (18-21°C)
- **Storage**: Below 40°F (4°C)

## Humidity Levels

Different growth stages require different humidity levels:

- **Colonization**: 65-75% relative humidity
- **Fruiting**: 85-95% relative humidity
- **Storage**: 35-45% relative humidity

## Lighting Requirements

While mushrooms don't photosynthesize, they do need some light:

- **Colonization**: No light required
- **Fruiting**: Indirect natural light or LED
- **Duration**: 12 hours light/12 hours dark

## Air Exchange

Proper ventilation is essential:

- **Colonization**: Minimal FAE (Filter patch is sufficient)
- **Fruiting**: Regular FAE (2-3 times daily)
- **CO2 Levels**: Keep below 1000 ppm

## Common Issues

Watch out for these environmental problems:

- **Too much moisture**: Can lead to contamination
- **Insufficient FAE**: Results in long, stringy growth
- **Temperature fluctuations**: Can stress the mycelium
