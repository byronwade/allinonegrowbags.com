    </Callout>

    <GuideStep number={1} title="Choosing Your Mushroom Variety">
        Start with beginner-friendly species:
        
        - **Best for beginners**: Oyster mushrooms (fast-growing, resilient)
        - **Avoid**: Morels or truffles (require advanced techniques)
        
        <Callout type="tip" icon="💡">
            Oyster, Shiitake, and Lion's Mane are excellent choices for indoor growing!

    <GuideStep number={2} title="Sterilizing Your Workspace">
        Contamination is the #1 reason for failure. Follow this checklist:
        
        1. Wipe surfaces with **70% isopropyl alcohol**
        2. Use a **still air box** (DIY with plastic tub)
        3. Wear **nitrile gloves**
        4. Flame-sterilize needles

    <GuideStep number={3} title="Inoculation Process">
        Follow these steps carefully:
        
        1. Shake spore syringe for 60 seconds
        2. Heat needle until red-hot
        3. Inject 3cc of solution into grow bag
        4. Seal port with micropore tape
        
        <Callout type="warning" icon="⚠️">
            Use 2-3cc per bag for optimal results.

    <GuideStep number={4} title="Ideal Growing Conditions">
        Maintain these conditions for best results:
        
        - **Colonization Phase**: 72-75°F (22-24°C)
        - **Fruiting Phase**: 65-70°F (18-21°C)
        - Humidity: 85-95%

    <GuideStep number={5} title="Harvesting Your Mushrooms">
        When and how to harvest your mushrooms:
        
        - Harvest when caps curl upward (before spores drop)
        - Twist gently at the base
        - Store in paper bags (not plastic)

    <FAQ items={[
        {
            question: "Can you grow mushrooms without a kit?",
            answer: "Yes, but all-in-one grow bags simplify the process for beginners by providing pre-sterilized substrate. They eliminate the need for complex sterilization equipment and reduce contamination risks."
        },
        {
            question: "Do mushrooms need sunlight?",
            answer: "No—mushrooms require indirect light or darkness during colonization, and minimal light during fruiting. Direct sunlight can actually harm mycelium growth and dry out your substrate."
        },
        {
            question: "What's the easiest mushroom to grow at home?",
            answer: "Oyster mushrooms are considered the easiest and most forgiving for beginners. They colonize quickly (14-21 days), are resistant to contamination, and fruit readily in a wide range of conditions."
        },
        {
            question: "How long does it take to grow mushrooms?",
            answer: "The total process typically takes 4-6 weeks from start to harvest. This includes 2-3 weeks for colonization and 1-2 weeks for fruiting, though timing can vary by species and conditions."
        },
        {
            question: "What temperature should I grow mushrooms at?",
            answer: "Most mushrooms prefer 72-75°F (22-24°C) during colonization and slightly cooler temperatures of 65-70°F (18-21°C) during fruiting. Maintain humidity at 85-95% during fruiting."
        },
        {
            question: "How do I prevent contamination?",
            answer: "Use sterile techniques: clean your workspace with 70% isopropyl alcohol, wear gloves, use a still air box, and ensure all tools are sterilized. Starting with pre-sterilized grow bags greatly reduces contamination risks."
        },
        {
            question: "What equipment do I need to start growing mushrooms?",
            answer: "Essential items include: grow bags or substrate, spore syringe or liquid culture, 70% isopropyl alcohol, gloves, and a clean workspace. A temperature control method and spray bottle are also recommended."
        },
        {
            question: "How do I know when mushrooms are ready to harvest?",
            answer: "Harvest timing varies by species. Generally, harvest when the caps begin to curl upward but before they drop spores. For oyster mushrooms, harvest when the caps flatten; for other varieties, harvest just before the veil breaks."
