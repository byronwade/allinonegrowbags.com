    ## What is an All-in-One Grow Bag?
    A pre-sterilized bag containing **substrate, grain, and a filter patch** for mushroom cultivation. Perfect for beginners because:
    - No mixing or sterilizing required
    - Built-in injection port for easy inoculation
    - Self-contained ecosystem reduces contamination risks

    <GuideStep number={1} title="Unboxing & Inspection">
        Before starting:
        
        1. Check for **intact seals** (no tears or holes)
        2. Verify the filter patch is **securely attached**
        3. Look for moisture droplets (sign of proper hydration)

    <GuideStep number={2} title="Sterilizing Your Workspace">
        Follow Google's top-searched sterilization method:
        
        - Wipe surfaces with **70% isopropyl alcohol**
        - Use a **still air box** (costs under $10 to DIY)
        - Flame-sterilize needles until red-hot

    <GuideStep number={3} title="Inoculation: Step-by-Step Process">
        Answering *"how much spore solution to use in a grow bag"*:
        
        1. Shake spore syringe for **60 seconds**
        2. Inject **2-3cc** through the self-healing port
        3. Seal the port with **micropore tape**

    <GuideStep number={4} title="Colonization Phase">
        Targeting *"how long does it take for a grow bag to colonize?"*:
        
        - **Timeframe**: 14-28 days
        - **Ideal Conditions**:
            - Temperature: 72-75°F (22-24°C)
            - Darkness or indirect light
        - **Signs of Success**: White mycelium spreading evenly

    <GuideStep number={5} title="Fruiting & Harvesting">
        1. Wait for **100% colonization**
        2. Cut a 2-inch slit below the filter patch
        3. Mist daily with distilled water
        4. Harvest when caps lift upward

    <FAQ items={[
        {
            question: "Can I reuse an all-in-one grow bag?",
            answer: "No—the substrate loses nutrients after harvest. Always start fresh for best results and to avoid contamination risks."
        },
        {
            question: "How much yield can I expect?",
            answer: "Typically 1-2 lbs of mushrooms per 5 lb grow bag, depending on the species and growing conditions. Multiple flushes are possible with proper care."
        },
        {
            question: "Do I need to water my grow bag?",
            answer: "Only during the fruiting phase—mist lightly 1-2x daily with distilled water to maintain proper humidity. Never water during colonization."
        },
        {
            question: "How long does colonization take?",
            answer: "Most species take 14-28 days to fully colonize at 72-75°F (22-24°C). The time can vary based on temperature and species."
        },
        {
            question: "What temperature is best for grow bags?",
            answer: "Maintain 72-75°F (22-24°C) during colonization, and slightly cooler 65-70°F (18-21°C) during fruiting for optimal results."
        },
        {
            question: "How do I know if my grow bag is contaminated?",
            answer: "Look for unusual colors (green, blue, black), sour smells, or slimy textures. Healthy mycelium should be white and smell earthy."
        },
        {
            question: "When should I open my grow bag?",
            answer: "Wait for 100% colonization (substrate completely white), then cut a 2-inch slit below the filter patch to initiate fruiting."
        },
        {
            question: "What's inside an all-in-one grow bag?",
            answer: "A pre-sterilized mixture of substrate and grain with a filter patch for gas exchange. The bag includes everything needed for mushroom growth in one convenient package."
