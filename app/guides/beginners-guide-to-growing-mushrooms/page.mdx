    <GuideStep number={2} title="Workspace Setup: Create a Clean Environment">
        A clean and organized workspace is key to successful mushroom cultivation:

        - Choose a room with **minimal air movement** to reduce contamination risks.
        - Clean all surfaces with **isopropyl alcohol** to ensure sterility.
        - Set up a **temperature control system** to maintain 70-75°F (21-24°C).
        - Ensure **indirect lighting** is available—mushrooms don't need direct sunlight.

    <GuideStep number={3} title="Sanitization: Keep Everything Sterile">
        Sanitization is the most critical step to prevent contamination:

        - Put on **fresh disposable gloves** before handling any materials.
        - Clean the **injection port** of your grow bag thoroughly with alcohol.
        - Wipe down all tools, including your spore syringe, with **70% isopropyl alcohol**.
        - Allow all surfaces to **dry completely** before proceeding.

        <Callout type="warning" icon="⚠️">
            Skipping sanitization can lead to contamination, ruining your entire mushroom grow. Don't cut corners here!

    </GuideStep>

    <GuideStep number={4} title="Inoculation: Introduce Your Spores">
        Now it's time to introduce your spores or liquid culture into the grow bag:

        - **Shake your spore syringe** well to distribute spores evenly.
        - Clean the needle with alcohol and insert it through the **injection port**.
        - Inject **2-3cc of spore solution** into the grow bag.
        - Seal the injection port to prevent contamination.

    </GuideStep>

    <GuideStep number={5} title="Colonization: Let the Magic Happen">
        After inoculation, your mushrooms will begin to colonize the grow bag:

        - Maintain a consistent temperature of **70-75°F (21-24°C)**.
        - Keep the grow bag **away from direct sunlight**—indirect light is best.
        - Store the bag **upright** in a clean, undisturbed area.
        - Check daily for **signs of growth** (white mycelium spreading through the substrate).

        <Callout type="tip" icon="💡">
            Patience is key! Colonization typically takes 2-3 weeks, depending on the mushroom species.

    ## What's Next?

    Once your grow bag is fully colonized, it's time to move on to the next stage: fruiting. This is when your mushrooms will start to grow and mature. Stay tuned for our next guide on creating optimal fruiting conditions!
