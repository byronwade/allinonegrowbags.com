		{
			question: "What types of mushrooms can I grow with these bags?",
			answer: "Our all-in-one grow bags are suitable for a wide variety of mushrooms, including oyster mushrooms, lion's mane, shiitake, and many other gourmet and medicinal varieties. The sterile substrate and grain mix provides an ideal environment for healthy mushroom growth.",
		},
		{
			question: "How long does it take to see results?",
			answer: "After inoculation, you can expect to see mycelium growth within 5-10 days. Full colonization typically takes 2-3 weeks, and fruiting can begin 1-2 weeks after that, depending on the mushroom species and environmental conditions.",
		},
		{
			question: "Do I need any special equipment?",
			answer: "Our bags are designed to be as user-friendly as possible. You'll need basic items like a clean workspace, alcohol for sterilization, and your chosen spores or liquid culture. For fruiting, you'll need a space with indirect light and proper humidity levels.",
		},
		{
			question: "How many flushes can I expect?",
			answer: "Most growers can expect 2-3 healthy flushes from each bag, though some species may produce more. The yield varies by mushroom variety and growing conditions, but each flush typically produces a substantial harvest.",
		},
		{
			question: "What's your sterilization process?",
			answer: "We use commercial-grade autoclaves to sterilize our bags at 15 PSI for 2.5 hours, ensuring a completely sterile growing environment. Each bag is then sealed with a self-healing injection port and filter patch for clean inoculation.",
